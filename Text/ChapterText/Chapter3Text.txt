[Right]
We're getting close. We ought to arrive[N]
at Lord Howard's castle within the hour.[AN]
[MidLeft][3LB]
Lord Howard... It's been years since[N]
I've last seen him. I hope he's as[N]
trustworthy as Ethan claims.[AN]
This doesn't feel like a trap, but I[N]
can't afford to make a mistake here.[AN]
Despite all we've accomplished, just[N]
one error could throw it all away.[AN]
Everyone's counting on me to lead[N]
them well, I can't let them down.[AN]
[Right][2LB]
I'll keep an eye on Ethan, but he[N]
doesn't strike me as dishonest.[AN]
Knightly types like him don't[N]
make great liars.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I expect you're right; if we was planning[N]
to betray us, he'd have done so already.[AN]
Still, I have no idea what to expect.[N]
Lord Howard's motivations elude me.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[FarRight][LoadEthan]
Prince Edgar, soldiers are approaching[N]
from all sides! We're surrounded![AN]
[MidLeft]
How'd they sneak up on us so easily?[N]
We should have been more vigilant.[AN]
[FarRight]
I don't know, my mission was top secret.[N]
Could we have been followed from Farval?[AN]
[Right]
Look at their positions; this was an[N]
ambush. They knew we were coming.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Does it look like we can slip past them[N]
and make a break for the castle?[AN]
[Right][3LB]
No way, they've completely cut off our[N]
path. A few of us might make it, but[N]
our odds are dire.[AN]
[MidLeft][3LB]
Then we've no choice but to make our[N]
stand right here! Ethan, you're with[N]
with us on the front lines.[AN]
I'm not in a trusting mood; it's time[N]
to prove your loyalties.[AN]
[FarRight]
Worry not, I'll protect you.[AN]
I don't know how they tracked us, but[N]
I'll make them regret crossing us![AN]

Sir Harris, we've been spotted![N]
What are your orders?[AN]
[ML]
The rest of our forces are nearly[N]
in position. Keep them busy for now,[AN]
then [ToggleRed]in five minutes we'll[N]

Sir, three horsemen approach from the[N]
south. We can't tell their affiliation,[N]
but they're not with us.[AN]
[ML][2LB]
Our target remains the same, but if[N]
they get in our way, wipe them out.[AN]

All this preparation to ambush so[N]

[MR][1LB]
You again...[AN]
[ML]
Have we met? You don't look familiar.[AN]
[MR][2LB]
Met? No, but I've been hired to[N]
kill you twice now.[AN]
Your little posse's quite popular,[N]
but I don't get it.[AN]
What makes you so special?[N]
I'd like to find out for myself.[AN]

[MidLeft][LoadEdgar][MidRight][LoadSasha]
Not bad! I can see the[N]
fire in your eyes.[AN]
I now understand how you[N]
made it this far.[AN]
[ML][1LB]
What are you rambling on about?[AN]
[MR][2LB]
You value whatever it is you're fighting[N]
for enough to put your life on the line.[AN]
It compels you to keep going, against[N]
overwhelming opposition.[AN]
I take it you could use some help[N]
evening the odds.[AN]
[ML][1LB]
You're offering to help us? Why?[AN]
[MR]
Would you prefer I cut you down instead?[AN]
[ML][2LB]
No, no, definitely not![N]
I'll gladly accept your help.[AN]
[MR]
Good, no need to waste more time[N]
talking. The battlefield awaits![AN]
[ClearFace][3LB]
[ML]
Whew, that was scary.[N]
I don't think I could have dodged[N]
any more of her attacks.[AN]
Come to think of it, she didn't[N]
even offer her name...[AN]

There was nothing my grandfather hated more than heavy armor. He crushed countless armored knights with his prized hammer.
I'm no good at fighting, but you look capable. Take this hammer, and carry on my grandfather's legacy!

How could this happen?[AN]

Those people he's fighting with[N]
must be the prince's group.[AN]

Thanks for your help, you[N]
really saved us back there.[AN]
I take it you're here on the[N]
behalf of Lord Howard as well?[AN]
[R]
Yeah, seems we made it just in time.[N]
Ethan, they knew you were coming.[AN]
I don't know how they knew, but[N]
they were ready to intercept you.[AN]
[FL]
I still can't believe this happened.[N]
Is the castle safe?[AN]
[FR]
It was when we left, and Sir Craig[N]
and the others are still there.[AN]
I doubt anything has happened in our[N]
absence, but I still feel uneasy.[AN]
Galt knows more than they should.[AN]
[L]
Then we've no time to waste.[AN]
Let's hurry back; with luck[N]
we'll still arrive before dark.[AN]
