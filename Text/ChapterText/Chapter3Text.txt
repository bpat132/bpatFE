We're getting close. I expect we'll arrive at Lord Howard's castle by sundown.
[MidLeft]
Lord Howard... It's been years since I've last seen him. I hope he's as trustworthy as Ethan claims.
[Right]
He's our best hope for retaking our country. I don't know what kind of man he is but we have little to lose by trusting he'll help us.
[MidLeft]
You're right. If he was planning on turning us over to Galt we wouldn't have even made it out of the city.

Prince Edgar, soldiers are approaching us from all sides! They've got us surrounded!
[Right]
What? How could they possibly ambush us here? They must have somehow known we were coming!
[FarRight]
Only a handful of people knew of this mission. If one of them has betrayed us...
[MidLeft]
Never mind that for now! Ethan, does it look like we can slip past them and make a break for the castle?
[FarRight]
I doubt it. They've completely cut off our path. We could try retreating the way we came, but that's risky as well.
[MidLeft]
We don't have anywhere to go if we turn back now. If they pursue us we'll be finished! We have no choice but to make our stand right here!

Sir Harris, we've been spotted! What are your orders?

[FR]Sir, we've sighted[ToggleRed]three cavaliers[ToggleRed][ToggleRed]approaching from the south.[ToggleRed]
They're about[ToggleRed]one minute away.[ToggleRed]
We can't tell their affiliation but they appear to be armed.
[ML]They're not our primary target, but if they engage, wipe them out.

Resorting to sneak attacks, even with overwhelming numbers. What a disappointment...

You again...
[MidLeft]
Have we met? You don't look like one of Galt's soldiers.
[MidRight]
I'm just someone who's been hired to kill you, twice now. Your little posse's quite popular, you know.
[MidLeft]
Any chance I could convince you to withdraw? If you have no allegiance to Galt, I've no reason to fight you.
[MidRight]
Hmm... You've got many battles ahead of you, do you not?
[MidLeft]
I... I haven't thought that far ahead, but until Melerra is free once more I'll never stop fighting.
[MidRight]
Then hire me. I've been dying for a taste of real battle, and it seems my best bet is to tag along with you.
I have no loyalty to Galt anyway, so I don't mind turning on them here.
[MidLeft]
Hire you? Sure, can't hurt to have you on our side. Better than having to fight you.
[MidRight]
Great. We can discuss payment once we're done killing my former employers.

You're here to protect us? Perhaps you'll find this hammer useful. Rumor has it hammers can crush heavy armor with ease, though I've only used it on nails myself.

Galt's soldiers think they can do whatever they please... It's sickening! Take this killer lance, and kill as many of them as you can!
