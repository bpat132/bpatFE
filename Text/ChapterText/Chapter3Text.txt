We're getting close. We ought to arrive at Lord Howard's castle by sundown.
[MidLeft]
Lord Howard... It's been years since I've last seen him. I hope he's as trustworthy as Ethan claims.
[Right]
This doesn't feel like a trap, but we can never be too careful. We don't have the luxury of making mistakes.
[MidLeft]
If he was planning on turning us over to Galt I doubt we'd have even made it out of the city. Still, it can't hurt to keep our guard up.

Prince Edgar, soldiers are approaching us from all sides! They've got us surrounded!
[Right]
What? How could they possibly ambush us here? They must have somehow known we were coming!
[FarRight]
Only a handful of people knew of this mission. If one of them has betrayed us...
[MidLeft]
Never mind that for now! Ethan, does it look like we can slip past them and make a break for the castle?
[FarRight]
Unlikely, they've completely cut off our path. We could try retreating the way we came, but that carries its own risks
[MidLeft]
We don't have anywhere to go if we turn back now. If they pursue us we'll be finished! We have no choice but to make our stand right here!

Sir Harris, we've been spotted! What are your orders?
[ML]
The rest of our forces are nearly in position. Keep them busy for now, then[ToggleRed]in five minutes we'll hit them with everything we've got![ToggleRed]

[FFR][MoveFarRight]
[FR]Sir, we've sighted[ToggleRed]three horsemen[ToggleRed][ToggleRed]approaching from the south.[ToggleRed]
They're about[ToggleRed]one minute away.[ToggleRed]
We can't tell their affiliation but they appear to be armed.
[ML]They're not our primary target, but if they get in our way, wipe them out.

Resorting to sneak attacks, even with overwhelming numbers. What a disappointment...

[MidRight]
You again...
[MidLeft]
Have we met? You don't look like one of Galt's soldiers.
[MidRight]
I'm just someone who's been hired to kill you, twice now. Your little posse's quite popular, you know.
[MidLeft]
Any chance I could convince you to withdraw? If you have no allegiance to Galt, I've no reason to fight you.
[MidRight]
Hmm... You've got many battles ahead of you, do you not?
[MidLeft]
I... I haven't thought that far ahead, but until Melerra is free once more I'll never stop fighting.
[MidRight]
Then hire me. I've been dying for a taste of real battle, and it seems my best bet is to tag along with you.
I have no loyalty to Galt anyway, so I don't mind turning on them here.
[MidLeft]
Hire you? Sure, can't hurt to have you on our side. Better than having to fight you.
[MidRight]
Great. We can discuss payment once we're done killing my former employers.

You're here to protect us? Perhaps you'll find this hammer useful. Rumor has it hammers can crush heavy armor with ease, though I've only used it on nails myself.

Galt's soldiers think they can do whatever they please... It's sickening! Take this killer lance, and kill as many of them as you can!

[FarRight]
All these soldiers... I hope we're not too late.
[Right]
I see Ethan in the distance, and those people he's fighting with must be Prince Edgar's group. They look badly outnumbered.
[MidLeft]
Then we've got no time to waste! We'd better hurry before they get overwhelmed.

[Left]
Thanks for your help, you really saved us back there. I take it you're employed by Lord Howard as well?
[Right]
That's right. Looks like we made it just in time. Is everyone alright?
[FarLeft]
I'm fine, but what are you three doing here? Shouldn't you be back at the castle?
[FarRight]
Scouts reported empire soldiers in the area. We came to make sure you were safe.
[Right]
Richard and the others can manage the castle without us. We'll be back soon enough anyway.
[FarLeft]
Could they have known we coming? This feels too convenient to be a coincidence.
[Right]
Even we only learned the details of your mission today. I doubt Lord Howard told anyone else but Richard and Sir Craig. Perhaps you were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time...
[FarLeft]
Perhaps... Either way, we'd best hurry to the castle then. We should still be able to make it back before dark, and I'd rather not chance another ambush.
[Left]
Agreed. Let's prepare to set out soon. We shouldn't risk staying here any longer than necessary.
