[ML]
Ugh, this place is disgusting![AN]
Out of all the routes to teh capital,[N]
why must we travel this way?[AN]
[MR]
It's important we remain unnoticed for[N]
as long as possible.[AN]
The army doesn't patrol these parts,[N]
so it should be our safest route.[AN]
We're unlikely to encounter anyone but[N]
scavengers and treasure hunters.[AN]
[ML][3LB]
I suppose that beats running into the[N]
army. Still, these ruins creep me out,[N]
I can't believe this used to be a city.[AN]
Feels like we might accidentally[N]
unleash an ancient evil.[AN]
[MR][2LB]
You read too many stories.[.4][N]
Watch your step![AN]
[ML]
Ah! This is terrible...[AN]
Wait, look over there.[N]
Seems we have company.[AN]
Hopefully they're just[N]
treasure hunters.[AN]
[MR]
Let's go and see, there's only[N]
two of them so it should be safe.[AN]

[FR]
How many of these goons are there?[AN]
Looks like we'll have to fight our[N]
way out after all.[AN]
[R]
Not a step closer![N]
Back off or I'll blast you to pieces![AN]
[FL]
Wait, wait! We're not looking to pick[N]
a fight, we're just passing through.[AN]
Do we look like highwaymen to you?[AN]
[L][1LB]
Are you two in some kind of trouble?[AN]
[R][3LB]
We're on an archeological expedition,[N]
looking to uncover lost artifacts from[N]
these ruins.[AN]
Turns out some bandits made this place[N]
their camp, and took offense.[AN]
[FR]
They must have the same idea as us.[N]
No doubt the treasure here is valuable,[AN]
but it'd be a shame for it to be[N]
looted and sold off.[AN]
[R]
Never mind that, Thomas. They're not[N]
gonna let us through without a fight.[AN]
[L][1LB]
Is there no way around them?[AN]
[FR]
Afraid not, the other passages we[N]
found are completely submerged[AN]
[L]
Then we've got little choice but to[N]
fight our way through.[AN]
Can I count on your help?[AN]
[R]
Of course, we graduated at the top[N]
of our class at the academy.[AN]
We can hold our own.[AN]

[L][LoadLucy]
I ought to thank them for leading me[N]
to all this treasure.[AN]
It'll be easy to slip away with the loot[N]
while everyone's busy killing each other,[AN]
then all I'll have to do is find somewhere[N]
to pawn it off.[AN]

[ML][1LB]
Ah, wait![AN]
[MR][2LB]
Shouldn't show off jewelry you aren't[N]
willing to part with around here.[AN]
Consider this a learning experience.[AN]
[ML]
No, that's not it.[N]
I- I want to hire you![AN]
[MR][1LB]
Huh?[AN]
[ML][2LB]
You don't look like such a bad person;[N]
you're at least not trying to kill us.[AN]
Plus, we could use someone with your...[N]
[q]unique" skills.[AN]
[MR]
Right... and why should I trust you?[AN]
Most people don't offer jobs to[N]
someone who just robbed them.[AN]
[ML][3LB]
I'm not like most people, and you'll[N]
be better off with us than hanging[N]
around sewer-dwelling bandits.[AN]
And you can keep that bracelet,[N]
think of it as part of your fee.[AN]
[MR]
Hahaha, you're serious? Sure, I'll do it.[AN]
You're the weirdest rich lady I've ever[N]
met, but I can't help but trust you when[N]
you say all that with a straight face.[AN]
Can't say I'm the greatest fighter around,[N]
but if you need some locks or pockets[N]
picked then I'm your girl.[AN]

[FL]
Whew, I think that's[N]
the last of them.[AN]
[FR]
Thanks for the help,[N]
you really saved us.[AN]
[L]
If anything, you helped us.[AN]
Those thugs weren't going to[N]
let us pass through either.[AN]
[R]
I don't mean to sound ungrateful,[N]
but who are you anyway?[AN]
The army wouldn't send troops[N]
somewhere like this.[AN]
[L][1LB]
Well...[AN]
[FL][2LB]
Edgar here's the prince of Melerra.[AN]
We're going to retake this country[N]
from Galt's clutches![AN]
Pretty exciting, right?[AN]
[R]
For real? Then what are you[N]
doing all the way out here?[AN]
[L]
We're hoping to avoid the army[N]
on our way to the capital.[AN]
Like you said, there won't be[N]
any soldiers here[AN]
[FR]
I know little about military matters,[N]
but your group looks a bit small.[AN]
With a force of this size, a surprise[N]
attack does seem ideal.[AN]
[L]
Yeah, we're outnumbered so we have[N]
to take any advantage we can get.[AN]
[R]
Hey, I have an idea.[N]
How about Thomas and I help you out,[AN]
and in exchange, should you prevail,[N]
grant us access to the castle's archives[AN]
[FR]
I don't appreciate being volunteered,[N]
but I'm on board.[AN]
They say its collection rivals the[N]
citadel's grand library.[AN]
What say you, prince?[AN]
[L]
Sounds good to me.[AN]
If we prove victorious, you can browse[N]
the archives to your hearts' content.[AN]
