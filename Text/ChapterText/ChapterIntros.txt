## TEXT_Ch1_Intro
Southern Rassica, once ravaged in[N]
war against the dragonkin, enjoyed[N]
nearly a century of peace.[AN]
This peace was shattered when three[N]
years ago, the Galt Empire invaded[N]
its eastern neighbor, the kingdom of[N]
Melerra.[AN]
The kingdom was ill-prepared for war,[N]
and struggled for nearly a year,[N]
before its nobility conspired to oust[N]
King Edwin and surrender to Galt.[AN]
The king's son, Prince Edgar, was[N]
away from the capital at the time[N]
and thus evaded capture by the empire.[AN]
Now a fugitive in his own country,[N]
he strikes back at Galt, blaming[N]
the empire for the abuses Melerra[N]
has suffered in recent years.[A]

## TEXT_Ch2_Intro
Once a thriving metropolis, the city[N]
of Farval has fallen on hard times.[AN]
While the outskirts are plagued by[N]
bandits and thieves, few dare to commit[N]
the slightest offense near the garrison[N]
at the heart of the city.[AN]
Erected shortly after the Great War,[N]
it now houses Galt's forces tasked with[N]
maintaining order in the city.[A]

## TEXT_Ch3_Intro
Taking Ethan at his word, Edgar and his[N]
allies head for Lord Howard's castle.[N]
Their route takes them though Melerra's[N]
southern plains; peaceful lands blessed[N]
with abundant natural resources.[AN]
Its many villages enjoy the security[N]
Lord Howard's forces provide, and in[N]
turn they top off his coffers and[N]
food stores.[A]

## TEXT_Ch4_Intro
When Galt conspired with Melerra's[N]
nobility to usurp King Edwin, Lord[N]
Howard, steward of the southern[N]
territories, was among their most[N]
fervent supporters.[AN]
Compared to the northern cities, Galt
Galt has little presence in southern[N]
Melerra, as settlements are sparse[N]
sparse and Lord Howard dutifully[N]
collects taxes on behalf of the empire.[AN]
Unsure of his benefactor's loyalties,[N]
Edgar approaches the castle with[N]
cautious optimism.[A]
[X]

## TEXT_Ch5_Intro
Hoping to delay a direct clash with[N]
Galt's forces, Edgar's group sails[N]
to Port Krast. Since Galt's invasion,[N]
corsairs from the southern isles grew[N]
increasingly bold in their raids.[AN]
The remnants of the Melerran army[N]
under Lord Louis shielded the port[N]
for some time, but recent reports[N]
indicate they were recalled to the[N]
capital weeks ago.[AN]
It is from here that Edgar will[N]
begin his march toward the capital[N]
Unbeknownst to him, his brief respite[N]
will soon come to an end...[A]

## TEXT_Ch6_Intro
Edgar and his allies opt to sneak[N]
through the ruins of the old capital,[N]
in order to evade detection by the army.[AN]
Once the pride of the kingdom and the[N]
home of the greatest mages and wisest[N]
scholars in the known continent, these[N]
decrepit ruins serve as a grim scar[N]
of the Great War.[AN]
Blades and spells proved ineffective[N]
against the dragonkin invaders from[N]
the north, and did little to slow[N]
their advance.[AN]
Unwilling to allow the city to fall into[N]
the hands of the enemy, the High Council[N]
made its final stand.[AN]
As the dragonkin breached the gates,[N]
humanity's greatest mages performed[N]
their greatest ritual and paid the[N]
ultimate price.[AN]
With no survivors, the details were lost[N]
to history, but not a soul within the[N]
city survived that fateful day, and[N]
decades of magical knowledge and[N]
countless powerful relics were lost.[AN]
Even now, with countries at war, the[N]
High Council's sacrifice is honored[N]
equally among them.[AN]
While unsanctioned looting is strictly[N]
prohibited, with the falling tide and[N]
lax security, daring treasure hunters[N]
and enterprising scholars occasionally[N]
come seeking lost records and artifacts.[A]

## TEXT_Ch7_Intro
Castle Melerra overlooks Edgar and[N]
his allies, as the approach from the[N]
south. Their adversaries scramble to[N]
rally their scattered troops to[N]
defend the castle.[AN]
Despite the element of surprise,[N]
Edgar's forces face great odds[N]
they must overcome. The castle is[N]
protected by the kingdom's two[N]
mighty generals, Gordon and Clint.[AN]
Furthermore, the infamously strong[N]
Lord Jeffery guards the castle gate.[N]
Having crossed the point of no return,[N]
Edgar and his friends prepare for[N]
their most difficult battle yet.[A]
[X]

## TEXT_Ch8_Intro
Having breached the castle gate,[N]
Lord Louis is the sole obstacle[N]
left standing between Edgar's and[N]
the Melerra's throne.[AN]
With General Gordon joining their[N]
side, spirits have never been higher.[N]
But Gordon advises caution, as Lord,[N]
Louis may still have cards he's yet[N]
to play.[A]
