[Right][3LB]
You can't be serious![N]
Assaulting the garrison head[N]
on would be beyond reckless.[AN]
[Left]
I'm dead serious.[N]
They'll never suspect we'd be bold[N]
enough to storm in with our numbers.[AN]
If we can take it, we should be able[N]
to drive Galt's forces from Farval.[AN]
With most of their army occupied with[N]
the war with Kemaroa, they won't be[N]
able to spare the troops to retake it.[AN]
[FarRight]
They won't expect it because it's insane![N]
I hate to shy away from a challenge, but[N]
these odds are a bit much, even for me.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Actually, we may have a chance.[AN]
Every hotshot officer wants to claim[N]
your bounties, so they've got patrols[N]
everywhere hoping to catch you.[AN]
We'll have to face Captain Osborne and[N]
his men inside, but frankly they're[AN]
hardly stronger or better equipped than[N]
the soldiers you've fought before.[AN]
[FarRight][2LB]
Well, if you think we've got a shot,[N]
count me in![AN]
[FarLeft][ClearFace]
[FarLeft][LoadNico]
[FarLeft][2LB]
Still, with just seven of us[N]
we'll be badly outnumbered.[AN]
[Right][ClearFace][FarRight][ClearFace]
[MidRight][LoadLisa]
[MidRight][1LB]
Eight of us. I'm coming with you.[AN]
[FarLeft][ClearFace]
[Left][3LB]
What?! It's far too dangerous for you.[N]
I appreciate all you've done for us,[N]
but I can't let you take this risk.[AN]
[Right]
I'm not asking your permission.[N]
You'll all get yourselves killed[N]
without me around to heal you.[AN]
[Left]
It doesn't sound like I can change[N]
your mind then...[AN]
Alright, you can come along,[N]
but please stay behind us[N]
where we can keep you safe.[AN]
[MidRight][2LB]
Of course. I'll make sure we all[N]
make it out alive.[AN]
[MidRight][MoveRight]
[FarRight][LoadJenna]
[FarRight]
I'm excited you're coming along, Lisa![N]
I could teach you how to shoot a bow.[AN]
[Right]
Uh, I appreciate the offer, but I'd[N]
prefer to stick to my healing staves.[AN]
[Left][3LB]
It's settled then.[N]
Everyone, make sure you're ready[N]
for our most important fight yet![AN]
[X]

## TEXT_Ch2_Start_Jane
[MidLeft][LoadJane][MidRight][LoadCh2Boss]
[MidLeft]
Sir, we're under attack![N]
Shall I join the vangaurd?[AN]
[MidRight]
No, I need you back here.[N]
Defend the throne room at all costs![AN]
[MidLeft][1LB]
Yes sir![AN]
[ClearFace]
[MidRight][2LB]
Damn, why'd I have to get stuck with[N]
this stupid noble?[AN]
Can't let her get herself killed or[N]
her brother will have my head.[AN]
That armor really cut into my budget,[N]
it better keep her alive and well.[AN]
[X]

## TEXT_Ch2_Runes
[MidLeft][LoadEdgar][MidRight][LoadLisa]
[MidRight][3LB]
One last thing, I brought a couple [ToggleRed]runes[ToggleRed][N]
from the temple. You know how to[N]
[ToggleRed]invoke[ToggleRed] them, right?[AN]
[MidLeft][2LB]
I know the theory, but I have[N]
little experience with them.[AN]
[MidRight][3LB]
I'd like you to hold onto them.[N]
As leader and tactician, you'd know[N]
best to effectively utilize them.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I appreciate your confidence in me,[N]
but wouldn't you be better able to[N]
use them than I?[AN]
Unlike you, I have no talent for magic.[AN]
[MidRight][2LB]
The energy used to invoke runes is[N]
separate from one's magical ability.[AN]
I believe you'll manage better than[N]
the rest of us.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Alright, I'll trust your judgment[N]
on this. Thanks, Lisa.[AN]
[X]

## TEXT_Ch2_Jane_Talk
[MidLeft][LoadEdgar][MidRight][LoadJane]
[ML][1LB]
Jane? What the hell are you doing here?[AN]
[MR][2LB]
Edgar?! How are you here?[N]
You're supposed to be dead![AN]
[ML][3LB]
Come on, you really think I'd die that[N]
easily? I can't die until I've paid Galt[N]
back for everything they've done.[AN]
[MR]
Oh, hm... that's a little awkward.[N]
I think this makes you my enemy.[N]
Sorry, but I can't let you through.[AN]
[ML]
You're really going to stand in my way?[N]
You may be a friend, but I've got too[N]
many people counting on me to back down.[AN]
I don't want to fight you, but I will[N]
if I have to.[AN]
[MR]
I'm a lot stronger than before. I may[N]
not be as talented as you or Jeffery,[N]
but I train twice as hard as anyone else.[AN]
So, why don't you just retreat?[N]
Then we won't have to fight.[N]
I'd really rather avoid it if we could.[AN]
[ML]
You're really okay with what the empire's[N]
doing? Doesn't it sicken you seeing our[N]
home exploited like this?[AN]
[MR][2LB]
It doesn't quite sit right with me, but[N]
my brother knows what he's doing.[AN]
He wouldn't have let it come to this[N]
if the alternative was any better.[AN]
[ML]
Fine, have it your way. I'll cut down[N]
anything in my way, even an old friend.[AN]
[CloseSpeechSlow]
[ML][MoveRight]
[MR][MoveFarRight]
[FR][3LB]
Ah, wait! I can't bring myself to fight[N]
you after all. I was really hoping you'd[N]
back down.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow]
[R][MoveLeft]
[FR][3LB]
Look, if I'm going to betray my allies[N]
by letting you through, how about[N]
letting me join you?[AN]
Not like I can go back. Dammit Edgar[N]
you really ruined my career here! This[N]
crusade of yours better be worth it.[AN]
[L][3LB]
Of course, I'd love to have you on[N]
my side. And I promise you, it's a[N]
cause truly worth fighting for.[AN]
[FR]
You owe me big for this. Well, no time[N]
for regrets; I'll clear the way for you.[N]
They'll regret slacking during training.[AN]
[ClearFace]
[L]
Whew, lucky she didn't realize my[N]
attack was a feint.[AN]
If it came down to it, I don't know[N]
if I could have brought myself to[N]
strike her down.[AN]
[X]

## TEXT_Ch2_End_Edgar
[MR][LoadEdgar][L][LoadKurt][FL][LoadLisa]
[L][1LB]
Looks like that's the last of them![AN]
[FL][2LB]
Whew, that was a lot more bloody[N]
than I expected.[AN]
I'll make sure everyone's alright.[AN]
[FL]
[ClearFace]
[L]
[ClearFace]
[MR]
We really did it.[N]
It hardly feels real...[AN]
[L][LoadDuncan][3LB]
Edgar, I found this man sneaking around.[N]
He says he wants to talk to whoever's[N]
in charge.[AN]
[FL][LoadEthan]
[q]Sneaking around," how absurd.[AN]
If I wanted to sneak in, I wouldn't[N]
have come by wyvern, would I?[AN]
[L]
Hm, I suppose not, but you were[N]
still acting suspicious.[AN]
It's not every day we see a[N]
wyvern rider around here,[AN]
and when we do they're with[N]
the army.[AN]
[MR]
It's fine, Duncan.[N]
I'll hear him out.[AN]
[CloseSpeechSlow]
[L][ClearFace][FL][MoveMidLeft]
[MR]
Well, I'm charge here. What[N]
is it you want with me?[AN]
[ML][3LB]
My name is Ethan, my employer is[N]
interested in the continued success[N]
of your anti-empire activities.[AN]
[MR][2LB]
An anonymous benefactor?[N]
Duncan was right, you are suspicious.[AN]
I don't want to turn down help, but[N]
surely you understand my hesitation.[AN]
[ML]
Fair enough, I'd be wary in your[N]
position too.[AN]
So you know that I'm here in good faith,[N]
I've brought with me 1,000 gold.[AN]
Use it for arms, supplies, whatever[N]
you deem necessary.[AN]
[MR]
That's a fair sum, but are there[N]
any strings attached?[AN]
No one gives out this much without[N]
expecting anything in return.[AN]
[ML][3LB]
None, but there's something I'd like[N]
cleared up. Your allies call you Edgar,[N]
the same name as the missing prince.[AN]
I've never met him, but you look the[N]
right age too. If you're not him,[N]
that'd be a heck of a coincidence.[AN]
[MR]
That's me, not that it matters much[N]
at this point. The kingdom of the[N]
past is gone for good.[AN]
[ML]
In that case, I can tell you everything.[N]
I serve under Lord Howard. I'm sure[N]
you're familiar with him.[AN]
[MR]
Yeah, he sold us out to the empire,[N]
and reaped the rewards.[N]
By all accounts he's a true loyalist.[AN]
[ML]
Then he's done well keeping up his image.[N]
In his current position, he can't afford[N]
to outwardly oppose the empire.[AN]
[MR][2LB]
If this is a ruse, it's an elaborate one.[N]
I'll take you at your word for now.[AN]
So what comes next?[N]
Surely Lord Howard has plans for me.[AN]
[ML][3LB]
Come to his estate, he'll discuss it[N]
with you in person. I can take you[N]
there myself if you're interested.[AN]
[MR]
I'm not going anywhere without my[N]
friends, I've only gotten this far[N]
with their help.[AN]
Besides, I'm not quite ready to put[N]
all my faith in you just yet.[AN]
[ML]
Very well, I can lead the way.[N]
Make your preparations, and we[N]
can depart when you're ready.[AN]
[X]

## TEXT_Ch2_End_MS
[MidLeft][LoadMatthias][MidRight][LoadStella]
[MR]
What the hell? Edgar's a *prince*?![N]
Did you know about this?[AN]
[ML]
No way, I'm as surprised as you.[AN]
It's hard to believe, but it[N]
explains his hatred of Galt.[AN]
[MR][3LB]
What a mess. I thought I'd head home[N]
after this fight, but it seems we're[N]
just getting started.[AN]
[ML][2LB]
You're sticking around?[AN]
I didn't think you particularly[N]
cared about the cause.[AN]
[MR][3LB]
I don't, but I'm not passing up the[N]
chance to have royalty in my debt.[N]
Besides, it'll get me out of this dump.[AN]
Been stuck here all my life and it's[N]
sickening. What about you?[N]
Guesssing you don't miss the army life?[AN]
[ML][2LB]
Not particularly. It feels good doing[N]
something that matters for a change,[AN]
and I don't have to follow that[N]
scumbag Casey's orders anymore.[AN]
[MR]
Heh, who hasn't had an awful boss or two.[AN]
A year back I worked at this kitchen,[N]
and the chef was a real piece of work.[AN]
Somehow lasted three months before[N]
I snapped and torched the place.[AN]
You know, I gotta admit, I'm dying to[N]
see how this'll play out.[AN]
We could be making history![AN]
[ML]
We could, or we could end up in a[N]
shallow grave in a couple weeks.[AN]
Here's hoping you're right.[AN]
[MR]
How optimistic of you.[N]
Guess we'll find out soon enough...[AN]
[X]
