You can't be serious![N]
Assaulting the garrison head[N]
on would be beyond reckless.[AN]
[Left]
I'm dead serious.[N]
They'll never suspect we'd be bold[N]
enough to storm in with our numbers.[AN]
If we can take it, we should be able[N]
to drive Galt's forces from Farval.[AN]
With most of their army occupied with[N]
the war with Kemaroa, they won't be[N]
able to spare the troops to retake it.[AN]
[FarRight]
They won't expect it because it's insane![N]
I hate to shy away from a challenge, but[N]
these odds are a bit much, even for me.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Actually, we may have a chance.[AN]
Every hotshot officer wants to claim[N]
your bounties, so they've got patrols[N]
everywhere hoping to catch you.[AN]
We'll have to face Captain Osborne and[N]
his men inside, but frankly they're[AN]
hardly stronger or better equipped than[N]
the soldiers you've fought before.[AN]
[FarRight][2LB]
Well, if you think we've got a shot,[N]
count me in![AN]
[FarLeft][ClearFace]
[FarLeft][LoadNico]
[FarLeft][2LB]
Still, with just seven of us[N]
we'll be badly outnumbered.[AN]
[Right][ClearFace][FarRight][ClearFace]
[MidRight][LoadLisa]
[MidRight][1LB]
Eight of us. I'm coming with you.[AN]
[FarLeft][ClearFace]
[Left][3LB]
What?! It's far too dangerous for you.[N]
I appreciate all you've done for us,[N]
but I can't let you take this risk.[AN]
[Right]
I'm not asking your permission.[N]
You'll all get yourselves killed[N]
without me around to heal you.[AN]
[Left]
It doesn't sound like I can change[N]
your mind then...[AN]
Alright, you can come along,[N]
but please stay behind us[N]
where we can keep you safe.[AN]
[MidRight][2LB]
Of course. I'll make sure we all[N]
make it out alive.[AN]
[MidRight][MoveRight]
[FarRight][LoadJenna]
[FarRight]
I'm excited you're coming along, Lisa![N]
I could teach you how to shoot a bow.[AN]
[Right]
Uh, I appreciate the offer, but I'd[N]
prefer to stick to my healing staves.[AN]
[Left][3LB]
It's settled then.[N]
Everyone, make sure you're ready[N]
for our most important fight yet![AN]

Sir, we're under attack![N]
Shall I join the vangaurd?[AN]
[MidRight]
No, I need you back here.[N]
Defend the throne room at all costs![AN]
[MidLeft][1LB]
Yes sir![AN]
[ClearFace]
[MidRight][2LB]
Damn, why'd I have to get stuck with[N]
this stupid noble?[AN]
Can't let her get herself killed or[N]
her brother will have my head.[AN]
That armor really cut into my budget,[N]
it better keep her alive and well.[AN]

## TEXT_Ch2_Runes

[MidRight][3LB]
One last thing, I brought a couple [ToggleRed]runes[ToggleRed][N]
from the temple. You know how to[N]
[ToggleRed]invoke[ToggleRed] them, right?[AN]
[MidLeft][2LB]
I know the theory, but I have[N]
little experience with them.[AN]
[MidRight][3LB]
I'd like you to hold onto them.[N]
As leader and tactician, you'd know[N]
best to effectively utilize them.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I appreciate your confidence in me,[N]
but wouldn't you be better able to[N]
use them than I?[AN]
Unlike you, I have no talent for magic.[AN]
[MidRight][2LB]
The energy used to invoke runes is[N]
separate from one's magical ability.[AN]
I believe you'll manage better than[N]
the rest of us.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Alright, I'll trust your judgment[N]
on this. Thanks, Lisa.[AN]

Jane? What the hell are you doing here?[AN]
[MR][2LB]
Edgar?! How are you here?[N]
You're supposed to be dead![AN]
[ML][3LB]
Come on, you really think I'd die that[N]
easily? I can't die until I've paid Galt[N]
back for everything they've done.[AN]
[MR]
Oh, hm... that's a little awkward.[N]
I think this makes you my enemy.[N]
Sorry, but I can't let you through.[AN]
[ML]
You're really going to stand in my way?[N]
You may be a friend, but I've got too[N]
many people counting on me to back down.[AN]
I don't want to fight you, but I will[N]
if I have to.[AN]
[MR]
I'm a lot stronger than before. I may[N]
not be as talented as you or Jeffery,[N]
but I train twice as hard as anyone else.[AN]
So, why don't you just retreat?[N]
Then we won't have to fight.[N]
I'd really rather avoid it if we could.[AN]
[ML]
You're really okay with what the empire's[N]
doing? Doesn't it sicken you seeing our[N]
home exploited like this?[AN]
[MR][2LB]
It doesn't quite sit right with me, but[N]
my brother knows what he's doing.[AN]
He wouldn't have let it come to this[N]
if the alternative was any better.[AN]
[ML]
Fine, have it your way. I'll cut down[N]
anything in my way, even an old friend.[AN]

Ah, wait! I can't bring myself to fight[N]
you after all. I was really hoping you'd[N]
back down.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow]

[FR][3LB]
Look, if I'm going to betray my allies[N]
by letting you through, how about[N]
letting me join you?[AN]
Not like I can go back. Dammit Edgar[N]
you really ruined my career here! This[N]
crusade of yours better be worth it.[AN]
[L][3LB]
Of course, I'd love to have you on[N]
my side. And I promise you, it's[N]
a cause truly worth fighting for.[AN]
[FR]
You owe me big for this. Well, no time[N]
for regrets; I'll clear the way for you.[N]
They'll regret slacking during training.[AN]
[ClearFace]
[L]
Whew, lucky she didn't realize my[N]
attack was a feint.[AN]
If it came down to it, I don't know[N]
if I could have brought myself to[N]
strike her down.[AN]

No need to point your spear at me, I'm[N]

[MidLeft]
I am now. By the look of your armor,[N]
and the fact that you're not trying to[N]
kill me, I assume you're not with Galt.[AN]
Well, out with it then. What is it you[N]
want from me?[AN]
[Right]
My name is Ethan, I'm here on the behalf[N]
of Lord Howard. I've been tasked with[AN]
investigating rumors regarding your[N]

Lord Howard? That's unexpected. What[N]
kind of rumors are you talking about,[N]
and why is Lord Howard interested?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Lord Howard? That's unexpected. What[N]
kind of rumors are you talking about,[N]
and why is Lord Howard interested?[AN]

Correct. My name is Ethan, I'm a mercenary employed by Lord Howard. I've been hired to investigate some rumors regarding your little army.
[MidLeft]
Rumors? Lord Howard? Now I'm curious. What kind of rumors have you heard about us, and why is Lord Howard interested?
[Right]
One year ago, when Galt joined forces with the treasonous Lords Louis and Jeffery and overthrew the King, all but one of the royal family perished, but Prince Edgar was never found.
Lord Howard believes that you are the missing prince.
[MidLeft]
[MoveMidLeft]
[MidLeft]
!!
[Right]
Judging by your expression, it seems Lord Howard is correct. He'd like to offer his support. Come to his castle and he'll provide you with mercenaries and funds.
[MidLeft]
How can I trust you? Lord Howard sold us out to Galt, and he still outwardly supports their rule.
[FarRight][LoadJane]
[FarRight]
I believe this man is telling the truth. Jeffery always suspected Lord Howard of opposing Galt behind the scenes.
[Right]
It's as you say. As proof, take this gift of 3,000 gold. Your weapons look rather worn so I suggest spending it to restock.
[MidLeft]
Thank you. I'll trust you for now. I imagine if you meant to betray us, you wouldn't go about it this way. We'll set out tomorrow and see what Lord Howard has to say.

What the hell? Edgar's a *prince*?! Did you know about this?
[MidLeft]
I'm as surprised as you. It's hard to believe, though it certainly explains some things. It's no wonder he's so determined, and his allies are so loyal.
[MidRight]
What a mess we've gotten caught up in. I thought this would be our last battle, but it looks like we're just getting started.
[MidLeft]
You're sticking around? I didn't think you were particular invested in the cause.
[MidRight]
I'm not, but it can't hurt to have a prince's favor. Plus, the prince and his friends are alright. What about you? Must be hard fighting against your countrymen.
[MidLeft]
It is... But we're making a difference, helping people. Feels like I'm finally fighting for something that matters.
[MidRight]
Heh, I didn't take you for much of an idealist. Though I gotta admit, I'm dying to see how this'll play out. Can we really take on the empire? Guess we'll find out soon enough...
