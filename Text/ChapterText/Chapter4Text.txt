[FarLeft]
Here at last. Welcome to[N]
Lord Howard's estate.[AN]
[Left]
Seems someone's riding out[N]
to greet us.[AN]
[Right]
That would be Sir Craig, commander[N]
of Lord Howard's knights.[AN]
[FarRight][LoadCraig]
You must be Prince Edgar, it is[N]
an honor to meet you.[AN]
I'm glad to see you alive and well,[AN]
I feared the worst when I heard[N]
you were ambushed.[AN]
Did you find out how they knew[N]
you were coming?[AN]
[FarLeft][3LB]
I'm afraid not, their leader was slain[N]
in battle and none of the survivors[N]
knew anything of value.[AN]
[FarRight]
That is unfortunate, then we're still[N]
in the dark.[AN]
It looks like you've had a long journey,[N]
I'll have the cooks prepare you all[N]
a warm meal.[AN]
[Left]
Sir Craig, I appreciate your hospitality,[N]
but I'd prefer to meet with Lord Howard[N]
first if possible.[AN]
[FarRight]
He's in a meeting at the moment, but[N]
I can request he join you in the[N]
dining hall. Come, I'll lead the way.[AN]
[X]

[Left][LoadEdgar][FarRight][LoadCraig]
[L]
The castle is much quieter than I[N]
expected. Are the other knights away?[AN]
[R][LoadBeatrice]
There are only a handful of us knights,[N]
and you've already met most of us.[AN]
Lord Howard also employs a fair number[N]
of local sellswords.[AN]
[FL][LoadIsabelle]
It's a sweet gig, it pays good and[N]
there's little conflict in these parts.[AN]
[FR][2LB]
It also keeps you from causing[N]
too much trouble.[AN]
[R]
That's right. Before he hired Richard[N]
to wrangle you all, things were messy.[AN]
Better to have them work for you than[N]
to clean up after them.[AN]
[FL]
Oh come on, Beatrice. You really[N]
think me a troublemaker?[AN]
[R]
No, you're just in it for the money.[AN]
Richard's a good guy, but I'm much[N]
less sure about the rest of them.[AN]
[FL]
Where is Richard anyway?[N]
I expected him to join us by now.[AN]
[FR][3LB]
Lord Howard sent him and some of his[N]
men to investigate reports of suspcious[N]
activity to the south.[AN]
[FL]
That's strange, I thought he didn't[N]
join us in our rescue mission in[N]
order to keep the castle safe.[AN]
[FR][2LB]
Indeed, but the circumstances changed,[N]
and I'm not one to question orders.[AN]
[FL][ClearFace][R][ClearFace]
[FL][LoadSasha]
I sense an air of bloodlust.[N]
Knight commander, explain yourself.[AN]
[FR]
[q]Air of bloodlust"? I won't dignify[N]
this drivel with a response.[AN]
Prince Edgar, you ought to mind the[N]
type of company you keep.[AN]
[FL][ClearFace][LoadNico]
No, something's off here.[AN]
I haven't seen a single servant[N]
since we arrived.[AN]
[R][LoadDaniel]
I'm sure there's a good explanation,[N]
right, Sir Craig?[AN]
[L]
Sir Craig, I must insist we see[N]
Lord Howard immediately.[AN]
He'll surely forgive us for the[N]
interruption.[AN]
[FR][3LB]
Gah, looks like we'll have to[N]
do this the hard way.[N]
Come on out everyone![AN]
[X]

## TEXT_Ch4_Start3
[ML][LoadCraig]
We have you surrounded.[N]
Surrender if you value your lives.[AN]
[R][LoadDaniel][3LB]
What is the meaning of this?[N]
Sir Craig, after all these years,[N]
how could you do this?[AN]
[ML]
You youths have the luxury of idealism,[N]
but you'll outgrow it with age.[AN]
I've wasted fifteen years as a knight.[N]
It's time for me to move up in the world![AN]
You're smart enough to see the way the[N]
winds are blowing.[AN]
Join me, and you'll have a bright future[N]
with Galt.[AN]
[R][2LB]
You know I could never do that.[N]
After all, you trained me better.[AN]
I don't want to fight you, but[N]
this is a line I will not cross![AN]
[ML]
Beatrice, at least you're bright enough[N]
to know what's good for you.[AN]
[FR][LoadBeatrice]
Hah, not a chance.[N]
No one respects a traitor.[AN]
[ML]
Even you, Isabelle? The empire's[N]
offering double your old wages.[AN]
Most of your mercenary pals were[N]
smart enough to join me,[AN]
and the rest didn't live long[N]
enough to regret it.[AN]
[R][ClearFace][LoadIsabelle]
Then they're dumber than I thought,[N]
I'm disappointed.[AN]
[ML][3LB]
Fine, I'm done wasting my breath.[N]
At least I gave you a chance.[N]
Don't hate me too much.[AN]
[ClearFace]
[R][ClearFace][FR][ClearFace]
[MR][LoadEdgar][2LB]
Twice in one day...[N]
Just when our luck was turning around.[AN]
[ML][LoadNico]
What's the plan? If we hurry we may be[N]
able to make a break for the exit.[AN]
[MR][3LB]
There's no point, we have nowhere to[N]
run to. Better to stay and fight than[N]
to get picked off as we flee.[AN]
Forget the exit, our objective is[N]
the throne![AN]
[X]



## TEXT_Ch4_Start4
[MidLeft][LoadCraig][MidRight][LoadCh4Boss]
[MidRight]
Excellent work, Sir Craig. Handle these[N]
upstarts and I'll see to your reward.[AN]
Just make sure to capture the prince[N]
and Lord Howard alive.[AN]
[MidLeft][1LB]
Worry not, I won't let them escape![AN]
[X]

## TEXT_Ch4_RC_Event
[MidLeft][LoadCameron][MidRight][LoadRichard]
[MR][3LB]
How could I let this happen?[N]
So many dead on my watch.[N]
Some leader I turned out to be...[AN]
[ML]
Get it together, boss! Sounds like[N]
others are still fighting out there.[N]
It's too early to give up just yet.[AN]
[MR]
You're right, we still have a job to do.[N]
There's strength in numbers, let's[N]
regroup with the other survivors.[AN]
[ML]
We'd better hurry, [ToggleRed]I hear footsteps[N]
approaching from the northern halls.[ToggleRed][N]
If we stay here we'll be pinned down.[AN]
[X]

## TEXT_Ch4_End
[R][LoadEdgar][FR][LoadRichard]
[FR]
Lord Howard, it's safe to come out.[N]
The fighting's over.[AN]
[ML][LoadHoward][3LB]
Gah, it was too cramped in there.[N]
Never though I'd have to hide in[N]
my own castle.[AN]
[FR]
I'm sorry, this was my failure.[N]
I didn't think my crew would be[N]
swayed so easily.[AN]
[ML][2LB]
There is no need to apologize,[N]
I share the blame.[AN]
I knew Sir Craig for decades, but[N]
I couldn't see through his deceit.[AN]
[R]
There's no point assigning fault.[N]
What matters is we made it though.[AN]
[ML]
Ah, Prince Edgar, it's been a while.[N]
I'm relieved that you're alright.[AN]
[R][3LB]
Lord Howard, it's been a long day,[N]
but let's get to the point of what[N]
exactly you summoned me here for.[AN]
After fighting two battles just to[N]
get here, I'm exhausted, but I won't[N]
be able to rest without answers.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[FR][ClearFace]
[ML]
Very well, I'll explain myself.[N]
As you're no doubt aware, the kingdom[N]
is in disarray.[AN]
Lord Louis is no fool, but he is[N]
unwilling to risk his position as[N]
regent to stand up to the empire.[AN]
Lord Jeffery, with the help of Generals[N]
Clint and Gordon, maintains order in the[N]
capital and surrounding cities.[AN]
However, the outer regions are at the[N]
mercy of imperial troops and bandits[N]
alike.[AN]
[R][2LB]
All this I know, but where do I come[N]
into the picture?[AN]
[ML][3LB]
In short, the current situation is not[N]
sustainable, and I alone lack the means[N]
to change it.[AN]
You, however, are a figure people will[N]
rally to support.[AN]
I'll support you in reclaiming the[N]
throne, so we can restore order and[N]
expel Galt's forces from our borders.[AN]
[R][2LB]
That's quite the proposition. Truthfully,[N]
I expected something like this from you.[AN]
What I don't get is why, and why now?[AN]
Don't think I've forgotten what you did[N]
two years ago.[AN]
Back then, you were happy to help oust[N]
my father and sell us out to Galt.[AN]
What changed?[AN]
[ML][3LB]
While I considered King Edwin a friend,[N]
he put us in an untenable position.[AN]
At the time, we were stuck in a war we[N]
could not win, and your father was too[N]
stubborn to admit we were beaten.[AN]
The war consumed too many resources,[N]
and our citizens were neglected.[AN]
Bandits ravaged the border villages,[N]
and pirates crippled sea trade.[AN]
Farmers were conscripted into the army,[N]
leaving us unable to feed the people.[AN]
In order to spare the people further[N]
harm, Lord Louis, Lord Jeffery, and I[N]
struck a deal with the empire.[AN]
[R][2LB]
And this deal didn't work out[N]
how you hoped?[AN]
[ML][3LB]
Indeed. It was fine for some time, but[N]
Galt demands more and more from[N]
us, which we struggle to provide.[AN]
Lord Louis overexterts his authority,[N]
imprisoning disenters and, I suspect,[N]
hoarding wealth for himself.[AN]
I tried to sway Lord Jeffery, but he[N]
was unwilling to budge.[AN]
[FR][LoadJane][2LB]
How like him. Once his mind is set,[N]
he'll never waver.[AN]
[ML]
Lady Jane, is that you? I didn't expect[N]
you to turn against your brother.[AN]
You know him better than I do, is there[N]
any chance you could change his mind?[AN]
[FR][3LB]
There's no chance. He already broke[N]
one vow, and he'd sooner die than[N]
break another.[AN]
[ML]
A shame, he's a good man, and would[N]
have made a valuable ally.[AN]
Prince Edgar, I understand if you're[N]
angry with me, but I did what I had to[N]
for the good of the kingdom.[AN]
I hope you understand.[AN]
[R]
I've had two years to be angry.[N]
There's no point anymore.[AN]
What am I going to do at this point,[N]
take revenge and strike you down?[N]
That wouldn't do anyone any good.[AN]
However, I cannot accept your offer.[N]
Someone like me doesn't belong on the[N]
throne.[AN]
I know little of governance and politics.[N]
How could I succeed where my father and[N]
Lord Louis failed?[AN]
[ML]
I'll do what I can to guide you, it's[N]
the least I can do as I'm partially[N]
responsible for the current situation.[AN]
[FR]
If it helps, there's no way governing[N]
will be harder than making it to that[N]
point in the first place.[AN]
If you can lead us to victory, I'm sure[N]
you can manage this as well.[AN]
[R]
Right, that's the other problem.[N]
How are we possibly going to win?[AN]
Generals Clint and Gordon stand in our[N]
way, along with Jane's brother who by[N]
all accounts is even stronger than them.[AN]
[FR][1LB]
Way stronger.[AN]
[R][2LB]
I'm not going to lead my friends to[N]
certain death. What's your plan?[AN]
[ML][3LB]
I've prepared a ship to take you all the[N]
way to Port Krast and enough gold to arm[N]
yourselves.[AN]
From there, it's a short trip to the[N]
capital.[AN]
You'll also have what remains of my[N]
knights and Richard's sellswords,[AN]
save the bare minimum needed to keep[N]
my territories safe.[AN]
The empire's surely suspicious of me[N]
by now, with luck they'll divert forces[N]
here, away from the capital.[AN]
[R][2LB]
I... I need to think about this.[N]
I'm sorry. I'll have an answer tomorrow.[AN]
[ML]
Very well, get some rest. You must be[N]
exhausted after all this.[AN]
[R][ClearFace][FR][ClearFace]
[ML]
I should have handled that better, it's[N]
a hell of a burden to place on him...[AN]
[X]

## TEXT_Ch4_End_Jane
[MR][LoadEdgar]
What should I do..?[AN]
I don't want to let everyone down, but[N]
is this really something I can handle?[AN]
[ML][LoadJane][1LB]
Couldn't sleep?[AN]
[MR][2LB]
How could I? I've been thinking and[N]
rethinking it all so much.[AN]
I'm truly at a loss.[AN]
[ML]
Um... do you want to talk it over?[AN]
I'm not great with heavy stuff, but[N]
I'm here if you need me.[AN]
Even if you did get me roped into[N]
this against my will.[AN]
[MR][3LB]
You know, I never thought I'd make it[N]
this far.[AN]
I fought back because I felt I owed[N]
it to Melerra, without worrying about[N]
about the big picture.[AN]
As much as I'd love liberate Melerra,[N]
I just don't know if we can do it.[AN]
The generals, your brother... how can[N]
we possibly defeat them? And say we do,[N]
Galt isn't going to simply vanish.[AN]
We'll have to deal with them afterwards,[N]
and who's to say I'll be any better than[N]
at this than my father or Lord Louis?[AN]
[ML]
Yeah, it'll be hard. But you never[N]
expected things to be easy, right?[AN]
It may look bleak, but it's far from[N]
impossible. I wouldn't have stuck with[N]
you if I thought you had no chance.[AN]
The generals are good men, you might be[N]
able to convince them to switch sides.[AN]
It wouldn't be the first time you made[N]
unlikely allies.[AN]
As for my brother, I don't know. We'll[N]
probably have fight him. Whatever you[N]
heard, he's even stronger than that.[AN]
But he's just one guy, I can't imagine[N]
you'll give up just beacuse of him.[N]
I certainly won't.[AN]
[MR][2LB]
I suppose it's possible, if Lord Howard's[N]
plan works out...[AN]
[ML][3LB]
And if you're worried about whether[N]
or not you'll make a good ruler, I[N]
think you'll do alright.[AN]
Can't say I'm a true believer like the[N]
rest of your allies, but you manage[N]
to hold this little group together.[AN]
Surely that has to count for something.[AN]
[MR][1LB]
I...[AN]
[ML][2LB]
I'll let you sleep on it, it's something[N]
only you can decide, after all.[AN]
[MR][3LB]
No need, I'll do it. You're right, it's[N]
possible, and if it's possible, we'll[N]
find a way to win.[AN]
I haven't brought everyone this far[N]
just to back down now.[AN]
Thank you, Jane. This really helped[N]
me clear my head.[AN]
