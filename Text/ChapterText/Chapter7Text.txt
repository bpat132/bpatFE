[MR]
Generals, I assume you've been briefed[N]
on the current situation?[AN]
[FL]
Yes, Prince Edgar has mustered quite the[N]
army, and now he's upon our doorstep.[AN]
I admit, this was beyond my expectations.[AN]
[L]
That naive fool![N]
Is he trying to get his men killed?[AN]
[FL]
He may have some trick up his sleeve.[N]
We'd do well not to underestimate him.[AN]
[MR]
Indeed, he made it this far on more[N]
than fortune alone.[AN]
Stille if all is as it seems, we'll[N]
crush his forces with ease.[AN]
We are better trained, better armed,[N]
and greater in number.[AN]
Guerilla warfare suited them better[N]
than a frontal assault.[AN]
[L]
Perhaps we could negotiate with him.[AN]
I doubt he wants to send his men to[N]
their deaths any more than we do.[AN]
Circumstances may have changed him, but[N]
he always struck me as a reasonable man.[AN]
Is there no hope for a peaceful[N]
resolution?[AN]
[MR]
I wish it were possible, but I do not[N]
foresee us coming to an agreement.[AN]
He has come too far to back down,[AN]
and there's little we're willing[N]
to concede.[AN]
[L]
You're right... Still, fighting him[N]
just doesn't sit right with me.[AN]
He doesn't carry his father's sins.[AN]
Many of his followers are rightfully[N]
displeased with Melerra's government,[AN]
and we've failed to address their[N]
concerns.[AN]
[FL][1LB]
Gordon, what are you saying?[AN]
[MR][2LB]
It's fine, Clint.[N]
You can always speak freely with me.[AN]
It's no secret the people are[N]
dissatisfied.[AN]
Regardless, we cannot allowed[N]
Melerra to descent into anarchy.[AN]
Think back to when we wrested control[N]
from King Edwin.[AN]
Were we wrong then, to save Melerra[N]
from certain doom?[AN]
Are we wrong now, to preserve order[N]
the best we can?[AN]
[L]
We weren't wrong, but it's only natural[N]
so many have flocked to Prince Edgar.[AN]
He promises a better future, while we[N]
maintain the status quo.[AN]
Something must change or we'll soon[N]
have another rebellion to contend with,[AN]
regardless of our victory here.[AN]
[FL]
I agree, our current situation is not[N]
sustainable.[AN]
Morale among my troops has never been[N]
worse, and not a day goes by that I don't[AN]
hear talk of dessertion or defection.[AN]
[MR]
Your concerns are noted, but now is not[N]
the time to discuss them further.[AN]
After this battle, I'll confer with[N]
Lord Louis.[AN]
There must be something we can do to[N]
ease the people's woes.[AN]
Still, our mission remains the same.[AN]
We will protect the castle and repel[N]
the prince's invading force.[AN]
No, not just repel them.[N]
We must defeat them so decisively,[AN]
that others will think twice before[N]
taking arms against us.[AN]
[L]...[AN]
[MR][MoveRight]
[FR][LoadLouis]
[FR]
I hope I'm not interrupting anything.[AN]
I trust your battle preparations are[N]
complete?[AN]
[R][3LB]
Yes, the prince's army approaches from[N]
the south, and our ground forces and[N]
ballistae are in position to greet them.[AN]
[FL]
Many of our forces are more than a day[N]
out, but the nearest should reinforce[N]
us before the enemy scales these cliffs.[AN]
[FR]
Excellent.[N]
Were I twenty years younger, I'd be[N]
itching to join you on the battlefield.[AN]
Alas, the years have not been kind to[N]
my sword arm. Best to leave the glory[N]
to the youngsters, no?[AN]
[R][2LB]
Hah, an old man like you would[N]
just get in the way.[AN]
[FR]
I can't argue with that.[AN]
Oh, and General Gordon, I need a quick[N]
word with you before the battle begins.[AN]
[L][1LB]
Of course, Lord Louis.[AN]

[ML][LoadClint][MR][LoadRose]
[ML]
The enemy draws near.[N]
Why aren't you at your post?[AN]
[MR]
General...[N]
It looks like Violet's defected.[AN]
[ML][1LB]
Are you certain?[AN]
[MR][2LB]
Even at this distance, I'd recognize[N]
her pegasus anywhere.[AN]
I can't believe she'd join the enemy![AN]
No, this is exactly the type of thing[N]
she'd do...[AN]
[ML]
Rose, are you alright?[AN]
As much as we could use your lance today,[N]
I won't make you fight against family.[AN]
I'll turn a blind eye if you sit this[N]
battle out.[AN]
[MR]
I don't know, general. I don't even know[N]
what we're fighting for anymore![AN]
Violet's impulsive, but she's not stupid.[AN]
She wouldn't defect unless she thought[N]
their cause was just.[AN]
Part of me wants to fly over there and[N]
knock some sense into her, and part[AN]
of me wants to hear her out.[AN]
[ML]
Then go. Talk to her, and decide[N]
for yourself what to do.[AN]
[MR][1LB]
But... Is this okay?[AN]
[ML][2LB]
Normally, no, but things are hardly[N]
normal anymore.[AN]
Now go, while you still have time.[AN]
[MR][1LB]
General...[AN]

Violet.[AN]
[MR][2LB]
Uh, hey sis.[N]
What're you doing here?[AN]
[ML]
What am I doing here?![AN]
You're the one who's gone[N]
and sided with the enemy.[AN]
What were you thinking?[AN]
[MR][3LB]
Well, they were fighting some pirates,[N]
Carter's crew, and I ended up helping[N]
them out before realizing who they were.[AN]
[ML][1LB]
And you decided to tag along?![AN]
[MR][2LB]
They seemed alright and we were heading[N]
the same way.[AN]
But all this time we've only fought real[N]
bad guys! Pirates, bandits, and thieves![AN]
When was the last time we did that with[N]
the army? I can't even remember.[AN]
[ML]
You're serious about this?[N]
This isn't another of your whims?[AN]
[MR]
Yeah, I guess I am.[AN]
Well, unless that makes us enemies now.[N]
I really don't want to fight you...[AN]
[ML]
No, I could never do that. No matter[N]
what, I'm always on your side.[AN]
Even if you're a real idiot sometimes.[AN]
[MR][1LB]
Hey![AN]
[ML][2LB]
Anyway, fill me in on what's going on[N]
here before I change my mind.[AN]
[MR][MoveRight][FR][LoadEdgar]
[FR][1LB]
Violet, who is this?[AN]
[R][2LB]
Speak of the devil.[AN]
Prince Edgar, this is my sister, Rose.[N]
She'll be joining us, I think?[AN]
[ML][1LB]
R-right...[AN]
[FR][2LB]
You're a pegasus knight too?[N]
We'll be glad to have you.[AN]
[ML]
Prince Edgar, about General Clint,[N]
please don't fight him.[AN]
I don't think he wants to fight you[N]
either. I'll try and talk to him.[AN]
[FR]
It's been many years since I've seen him,[N]
but I remember him being a good man.[AN]
I've no desire to fight him unless he[N]
gives us no choice.[AN]
If Violet trusts you, then I'll trust[N]
you too.[AN]

[MR]
General, I... I don't want to fight you,[N]
or anyone else here, but...[AN]
[ML]
So you, too, have been swayed[N]
to their side?[AN]
You find their cause more[N]
righteous than ours?[AN]
[MR]
I do. I don't see a point anymore.[AN]
How could I turn my lance on those[N]
seeking a brighter future?[AN]
[ML]
A brighter future... But does[N]
Prince Edgar have what it takes?[AN]
Even if he wins this battle,[N]
Melerra's problems run deep.[AN]
Solving them will be no easy task.[AN]
[MR]
Truthfully, I'm not sure. Even so,[N]
I can't bring myself to oppose him.[AN]
If this makes me naive, so be it.[AN]
[ML]
I expected as much, this doesn't[N]
surprise me.[AN]
Then I will join you, fighting[N]
on the prince's side.[AN]
[MR][1LB]
General?[AN]
[ML][3LB]
I don't know if he can save our kingdom,[N]
but at least I want to believe there's[N]
something we can do.[AN]
Perhaps this makes me naive as well,[N]
but at least I'll be in good company.[AN]
[MR][1LB]
General... Thank you.[AN]

Apologies, I was lost in thought.[AN]
Should the enemy near the castle,[N]
we will finish them off.[AN]
Until then, we hold this position.[AN]
[CloseSpeechSlow][MR][ClearFace]
[ML]
What a fool I've been.[AN]
I knew Louis was not above blackmail,[N]
I never thought he'd go this far...[AN]
Perhaps this is what I deserve for[N]
not taking action sooner.[AN]

No matter how much I study, I can't use this tome! Maybe I wasn't cut out to be a mage after all. Here, you can have it. Better to give it away than leave it on my bookshelf.

A priest once gave me this lance, he said it would help keep me safe. Turns out I'm terrible at spearfighting so it's useless to me. Hopefully you can put it to better use.

[ML]
Gordon, Lord Jeffery...[N]
Was there no other way?[AN]
[MR][LoadEdgar]
[MR]
General Clint, thank you for[N]
your assistance.[AN]
This victory was in no small[N]
part thanks to you.[AN]
[ML]
Victory? This is no victory.[AN]
Lord Louis still lives while Lord[N]
Jeffery and General Gordon are dead.[AN]
They were good men, and my friends.[N]
We may not have always seen eye to eye,[AN]
but they, too, wanted nothing but the[N]
best for Melerra.[AN]
[MR]
I... I wish we didn't have to fight them.[AN]
I didn't know them as well as you, but[N]
I still knew them.[AN]
General Gordon even taught me[N]
spearfighting![AN]
And I used those skills to...[N]
No, this is no time for self-pity.[AN]
I can process this later, after[N]
we've dealt with Lord Louis.[N]
He's hiding inside the castle?[AN]
[ML]
He is indeed. He's no fighter himself,[N]
but he's a real snake.[AN]
Take care not to be caught[N]
off-guard by his tricks.[AN]
[MR]
Thanks for the warning, I'll keep my[N]
guard up. We've come to far to fail now.[AN]
