[Left]
Damn, this place is already[N]
packed with soldiers.[AN]
[FarLeft][3LB]
Guess we've really made a name[N]
for ourselves. I hear there's[N]
a 5000 gold bounty on each of us![AN]
It's a bit insulting, isn't it?[N]
I should be worth at least 10,000...[AN]
[Right]
You'd think with these numbers they'd[N]
have no trouble handling some bandits.[N]
Why do we have to do their job for them?[AN]
[FarRight]
Rumor has it that the soldiers turn[N]
a blind eye in exchange for a[N]
cut of the profits.[AN]
We'll find out how true that is[N]
soon enough.[AN]
[Left]
It doesn't matter now, anyone who preys[N]
on the innocent is our enemy.[AN]
We'll drive off the bandits, then[N]
[ToggleRed]take out the troops' leader and escape[ToggleRed][N]
before they can rally more soldiers.[AN]

[3LB]
Troops, today we bring down the[N]
vigilantes plaguing our city![N]
Dead or alive, it doesn't matter to me.[AN]
Get the job done and I'll see to it[N]
you're rewarded.[AN]
[MidLeft][LoadMatthias]
Respectfully, sir, what of the bandits?[N]
I've never seen them so brazen, and[N]
the townsfolk are getting anxious.[AN]
We were never popular before, but now[N]
it's as if the whole city's against us.[AN]
[MidRight]
Hah, nothing's ever good enough for them.[AN]
You'd think they'd be more appreciative[N]
when just one year ago they hailed us[N]
as saviors.[AN]
Leave the bandits be, we'll use them[N]
to our advantage. While they keep the[N]
rebels busy, we'll close in on them.[AN]
[MidLeft][1LB]
I see, that hadn't occured to me, sir.[AN]
[MidRight][3LB]
Heh, that's why Captain Osborne put me in[N]
charge. Brute force ain't always enough,[N]
you have to outsmart them too.[AN]
With bandits as bait, rebels will play[N]
right into our hands.[N]
This battle's as good as won.[AN]
[MidRight][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][2LB]
How callous...[N]
What happened to our principles?[AN]
I'd never have enlisted if I[N]
knew it'd turn out like this.[AN]

## TEXT_Ch1_Edgar_Matthias_Talk
[MidLeft][LoadEdgar][MidRight][LoadMatthias]
[MidRight]
Hey, you with the spear.[N]
You're the vigilantes' leader, right?[AN]
[MidLeft][1LB]
That I am. What's it to you?[AN]
[MidRight][3LB]
I'd like to help you out, at least for[N]
now. You're the only ones doing any good[AN]
here, and I'd sooner forsake the empire[N]
than my convictions.[AN]
I enlisted because I thought I could[N]
help people, but this...[N]
It isn't what I'd envisioned.[AN]
[MidLeft][3LB]
I normally wouldn't trust a soldier so[N]
easily, but I can't deny we're lacking[N]
in numbers.[AN]
We could use all the help we can get.[N]
But are you sure you're okay with this?[N]
You won't be able to turn back.[AN]
[MidRight][2LB]
Yeah, this feels right. Heh, I'm getting[N]
fired up already. Let's do this![AN]
[X]

## TEXT_Ch1_Stella_Event1
[MidLeft][LoadStella][3LB]
Nothing good today either...[N]
Can't believe I'm reduced to looking[N]
for tomes on the black market.[AN]
Don't know why I bother anymore,[N]
they never have the good stuff.[AN]
[FarRight][LoadRedSoldier]
[FarRight]
Be careful out there, miss.[AN]
A gang of rebels is causing trouble[N]
in this area, wouldn't want you to[N]
get caught up in the mess.[AN]
Stay indoors until we've dealt with them.[AN]
[MidLeft][1LB]
Right, I'll be on my way then.[A]
[FarRight][3LB]
Hold up, I'll need to inspect that book[N]
you've got there. Have to make sure[N]
it isn't contraband.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[MoveFarLeft]
[FarLeft][2LB]
Not a chance! One step closer[N]
and I'll blow you to pieces![AN]
[FarRight][MoveRight]
Aha! I knew it was a magic tome. Heh,[N]
guess I can judge a book by it's cover.[AN]

## TEXT_Ch1_Stella_Battle

You really want your last words[N]
to be a dumb joke?[AN]
Don't say I didn't warn you.[A]

## TEXT_Ch1_Stella_Event2
[MidLeft][LoadStella]
[FarFarRight]
That girl just blew up Johnny![N]
She must be with the rebels, get her![AN]
[MidLeft][3LB]
Ugh, so much for keeping a low profile.[N]
Rebels, huh... Maybe they'll help keep me[N]
alive now that we've got a common enemy.[AN]
[X]

## TEXT_Ch1_Edgar_Stella_Talk
[MidLeft][LoadEdgar][MidRight][LoadStella]
[MidRight]
Hey, you! Are you the leader of[N]
this group? I wanna join you.[AN]
[MidLeft][1LB]
Huh? Who are-[AN]
[MidRight][3LB]
I'll level with you, these soldiers are[N]
real pissed at me. You keep them off[N]
my back, and I'll fry them for you.[AN]
I'm no musclehead like the rest of you[N]
but I'm real good with magic.[AN]
[MidRight][ClearFace]
[MidLeft]
Musclehead? She's already gone.[N]
What a strange woman... But if she[N]
wants to join us, I won't stop her.[AN]

[MR][LoadCh1Boss]
[MR]
What're you doing dozing off? You gonna[N]
fight or is that sword just for show?[AN]
[ML][OpenEyes][3LB]
Nah, why bother? We already have them[N]
outnumbered five to one...[AN]
Well, not anymore. Looks like there's[N]
more of them now. Wasn't guy in the[N]
blue armor on our side earlier?[AN]
[MR][CloseEyes]
Matthias, you fool...[AN]
[OpenEyes]Look, the situation's not great.[N]
I've got a lot of men but they ain't[N]
exactly the best and brightest, ya know?[AN]
That's why I hired you, we need a real[N]
professional to get things done.[AN]
[ML]
Ah, yeah, I see what you mean.[N]
But fighting alongside a bunch of[N]
weaklings just isn't my style.[AN]
It's like they're not even trying,[N]
and it's really killing the mood.[AN]
[MR]
The mood? Who cares about that?![N]
I didn't pay you to sass me, if you[N]
want your coin it's time to earn it.[AN]
[ML]
Keep your money, I'm done here.[N]
I need to start picking my employers[N]
more carefully.[AN]
[ML][ClearFace]
[MR]
This just isn't my day...[AN]
Captain Osborne's gonna make an example[N]
out of me if the rebels slip through[N]
my grasp again...[AN]

Bandits are attacking? Oh no... I'm worried about my niece, she hasn't come back from the market yet. If you see her, please give her this thunder tome so she can defend herself.

[MidLeft][LoadFace][0x5A][0x01][MidRight][LoadFace][CurrentPortrait]
[MidLeft]
Stella? What's got you so worked up?
[MidRight]
I got myself caught up in something, but don't worry, I'll take care of it. Just stopping by to pick up my thunder tome and warn you to stay indoors, there's a hell of a fight going on outside.
[MidLeft]
A fight?! What have you gotten yourself into?
[MidRight]
Don't worry about it, uncle. I'll be fine.
[MidLeft]
But... Alright, I know better than to try to talk you out of this. Just please, come back safe.
[MidRight]
I will, I promise.

[MidLeft]
Ya know, I used to support Galt, thinking they'd treat us better than the kingdom did. Man, do I feel silly now.
Take this steel blade, maybe it'll help you beat 'em.
I gotta warn you, it takes a skilled swordsman to land a hit with this weapon, but it packs a hell of a punch!

[FarLeft][2LB]
Welcome back! Oh, looks like[N]
there's some new faces here.[AN]
[Left]
Hi Lisa. These two are...[N]
Actually, I never caught your names.[AN]
[Right][3LB]
Matthias. I was a soldier of Galt until[N]
today, but I can no longer abide by the[N]
army's callousness.[AN]
[FarRight][2LB]
And I'm Stella. Looks like I'm[N]
stuck with you now.[AN]
[FarLeft][3LB]
It's a pleasure to meet you two.[N]
I'm Lisa, I run this temple that[N]
they've made into a hideout.[AN]
Not like I've got much else to do,[N]
hardly anyone else comes here[N]
these days.[AN]
[Left][2LB]
And I'm Edgar, I'm the leader of our[N]
little resistance force.[AN]
Matthias and Stella really helped[N]
us out in our last battle.[AN]
[Right][ClearFace][FarRight][ClearFace]
[Left][ClearFace][MidRight][LoadEdgar]
[FarLeft][MoveMidLeft]
[MidLeft]
Two new friends and you're still[N]
scratched up this bad?[AN]
Please, be more careful.[N]
Even I can't heal a fatal wound.[AN]
[MidRight]
Thanks for healing us up, Lisa.[N]
I don't know what we'd do without you.[AN]
[MidLeft]
If you really want to thank me, quit[N]
being so reckless![AN]
I really worry about you guys. So does[N]
Nico, though he'd never admit it.[AN]
[MidRight][3LB]
Speaking of Nico, is he back yet?[N]
I hope his mission went smoother[N]
than ours.[AN]
[MidLeft][2LB]
He came back about an hour ago,[N]
asked me to give you these.[AN]
[MidRight][2LB]
Impressive as always, I'll[N]
have to thank him later.[AN]
[MidLeft][ClearFace]
[MidRight]
Finally, fortune shines on us.[AN]
Perhaps it's finally time to[N]
try something more ambitious.[AN]
