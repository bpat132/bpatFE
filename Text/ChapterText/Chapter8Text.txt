This is bad... If they beat Lord Jeffery,[N]
that means I'm next![AN]
No sense fighting for the losing side.[AN]
If I'm gonna die, it sure ain't gonna[N]
be protecting the likes of Lord Louis.[AN]
I just gotta find the right moment to[N]
defect...[AN]

[ML]
Hey you, yeah you![AN]
I'm Victoria, and I'm done with this[N]
whole soldiering business.[AN]
Starting today I'm a mercenary, and I'm[N]
giving you the opportunity to hire me.[AN]
Aren't you lucky! I'm a real menace with[N]
a spear.[AN]
We can talk payment later, after[N]
you've seen me in action.[AN]

## TEXT_Ch8_Start_Louis
[ML][LoadLouis][MR][LoadRedSoldier]
[ML]
So Lord Jeffery has fallen, and[N]
General Clint has betrayed us...[AN]
[MR]
I'm afraid so, milord. I could[N]
hardly believe it myself.[AN]
[ML][3LB]
It pains me to say this, but what's[N]
done is done.[AN]
We are Melerra's last line of defense,[N]
and we will not yield to these invaders![AN]
Distrubte these amulets to the rest of[N]
the castle guard, they will allow you[N]
to [ToggleRed]pass through the light barriers.[ToggleRed][AN]
[MR][2LB]
Thank you, milord. We will protect[N]
the castle with our lives![AN]
[ML]
One more thing, [ToggleRed]eliminate the prisoners.[ToggleRed][AN]
They wouldn't hesitate to join the[N]
enemy's ranks.[AN]
We mustn't give them the opportunity.[AN]
[MR]
...[N]
Understood, milord.[AN]
[ClearFace]
[ML]
This sort of miscalculation is unlike me.[N]
I never expected they'd sway Clint,[AN]
and even then, to best Jeffery?[AN]
I'll have to ready my exit strategy[N]
in case the situation gets dire.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[MR][LoadMystery]
You aren't thinking of running away,[N]
are you?[AN]
You're a coward through and through.[AN]
[ML]
Damn witch! I'll never get used to[N]
your habit of sneaking up on me.[AN]
[MR][3LB]
You should know, your friend Jeffery had[N]
the secret tunnels sealed, so don't bother[N]
trying to escape.[AN]
He said it was to keep the prince from[N]
sneaking through them, but I think he[N]
didn't want you abandoning your post.[AN]
What's that old saying, [q]the captain goes[N]
down with his ship?" You're not much of a[N]
captain, but it feels appropriate.[AN]
[ML][2LB]
So you've come here to gloat?[N]
Is that it?[AN]
[MR]
I won't deny I enjoy making you squirm,[N]
but I'm really here for another reason.[AN]
I know you've been holding out on me.[AN]
You never fulfilled your end of our[N]
deal. I'm giving you once last chance.[AN]
[ML]
What are you talking about?[N]
I did everything you asked.[AN]
[MR]
Don't play dumb, I tolerated you keeping[N]
it as a contingency, but I always knew.[AN]
Bring me the spear and I'll save your[N]
pitiful life. I won't even hold a grudge.[AN]
[ML]
Hah, hahaha! Of course you knew![N]
I played into your hands from the start.[AN]
But no more! Call me what you will, but[N]
I am a patriot to the end.[AN]
For the sake of Melerra... No, for the[N]
sake of humanity, you'll never have it![AN]
[MR]
For the sake of humanity? You[N]
think too highly of yourself.[AN]
Good luck, Lord Louis, and goodbye.[AN]
[ClearFace]
[ML]
That was my last out...[N]
Back to plan A, then.[AN]
I know this castle like the[N]
back of my hand.[AN]
I won't let these interlopers[N]
best me in my own domain![AN]

## TEXT_Ch8_Start_Clint
[ML][LoadEdgar][MR][LoadClint]
[ML]
There are more enemy soldiers inside[N]
the castle than I expected.[AN]
Why weren't they deployed outside?[AN]
[MR]
Lord Louis is incredibly cautious,[AN]
he must have kept them in reserve[N]
in case you made it this far.[AN]
I wouldn't be surprised if he had further[N]
contingencies prepared as well.[AN]
[ML]
Then we'll have to be ready for anything.[N]
After coming so far, we can't slip up.[AN]
Finally, victory is within reach, and[N]
once we strike down Lord Louis,[AN]
Melerra will once more be free.[AN]
[MR]
Things are never that simple.[AN]
Whatever happens today, it will take[N]
years for Melerra to recover.[AN]
[ML]
You're right, winning here won't solve[N]
everything.[AN]
Still, we'll take it once step at a time,[N]
and our next step is retaking the throne![AN]

## TEXT_Ch8_Start_Edgar
[L][LoadEdgar][3LB]
Listen up, everybody![AN]
Everything we've fought for, everything[N]
you've put your lives on the line to[N]
achieve, is finally within our grasp![AN]
The traitor, Louis, sits atop the throne.[N]
We face his few remaining loyalists, and[N]
whatever devious traps he set for us.[AN]
But together, they are nothing before us![AN]
You all put your faith in me, and I, in turn[N]
put my faith in you. To victory![AN]

Save your breath, Donovan.[N]
They're not gonna tell us a thing.[AN]
[ML]
Gah, this is the worst![AN]
A fight for the future of our country,[N]
and we're stuck in this cell.[AN]
[MR]
Maybe they'll bust us out, but[N]
until then, save your energy.[AN]
Shouting won't do us any good.[AN]
[ML]
Yeah, you're right.[AN]
When we get out of here, let's give[N]
these traitors what they deserve![AN]

Argh, what the hell is this?![AN]

I knew Louis was twisted,[N]
but this is insane![AN]
What kind of villain thinks[N]
up something like this?[AN]
[MR]
Perhaps we've outlived our[N]
usefulness as hostages...[AN]
Let's hope help comes quick.[AN]

Thanks for saving us.[AN]
You're here to kill Louis, right?[N]
Count me in.[AN]

Free at least. Now it's time[N]

[R]
Louis, it's time to pay[N]
for what you've done![AN]
[FL][1LB]
Wait, wait! I surrender![AN]
[R]
You... surrender?[AN]
[FL][2LB]
I won't apologize or make excuses.[AN]
I did what I did for Melerra, but[N]
now that you've defeated me,[AN]
I've no reason not to cooperate.[AN]
[R]
A reason for everything?[AN]
Let's hear your reason for letting[N]
the empire abuse our citizens.[AN]
[FL]
You're young, and idealistic.[N]
I wouldn't expect you to understand.[AN]
[R]
No, I understand plenty.[AN]
You pay no mind to the people's suffering,[N]
as long as you stay in power.[AN]
[FL]
I've made many difficult decisions. Things[N]
aren't as black and white as you think.[AN]
[FR][LoadMarie]
What the hell?![N]
Don't listen to a word he says![AN]
In all my life, I've never met[N]
such a twisted fiend.[AN]
[R][1LB]
Twisted?[AN]
[FR][2LB]
You didn't know? He imprisoned me to hold[N]
me as leverage against my father.[AN]
Then after he had no more use for me,[AN]
he tried to kill me anyway, along[N]
with all the other prisoners![AN]
By burning us alive![AN]
[ClearFace][LoadDonovan]
She's right.[N]
Louis is a vile, irredeemable man.[AN]
Melerra is better off without him.[AN]
[FL]
You fools, you don't know the sacrifices[N]
I've made for this country.[AN]
[FR][ClearFace][LoadTrent]
Don't listen to him, you can't trust[N]
a word he says.[AN]
Give him the slightest opportunity[N]
and he'll stab you in the back.[AN]
[ClearFace][LoadEvelyn]
If you're feeling squeamish I'd be[N]
happy to dispose of him for you.[AN]
He'd make a great test subject...[AN]
[FL][1LB]
...[AN]
[FR][ClearFace]
[R][2LB]
You won't even deny it?[N]
Then you truly are beyond salvation.[AN]

[L][LoadCelia]
[1LB]
Edgar, stop! You can't do this![AN]
[R]
Celia..?[AN]
[L][2LB]
This isn't like you![N]
Killing someone who can't fight back...[AN]
You just can't![AN]
[R]
But think about everything he's done![N]
Doesn't it fill you with rage?[AN]
It's unforgivable![AN]
[L]
Of course it does! But don't do[N]
something you can't take back.[AN]
Let him rot in the dungeon![N]
Isn't that good enough?[AN]
[R]
So many people have died because of him.[N]
Died so that we could finally be rid of him.[AN]
And yet he still lives...[AN]
Fine, I accept your surrender.[AN]
You can stay in that deathtrap of a prison[N]
until I figure out what to do with you.[AN]
Get him out of my sight.[AN]

[MR]
Dammit! We worked so hard for this,[N]
but it all feels so hollow now.[AN]
Am I in over my head after all?[AN]
[FL][LoadClint]
[FL]This is but the first of many[N]
trials you'll face as king.[AN]
But if you could make it this far,[N]
you'll find a way to manage this too.[AN]
[MR]
King? No, no... I'm not ready for this.[N]
How could I be?[AN]
[L]
You'll be alright.[AN]
You have me, Clint, Lord Howard, and[N]
all the rest of us to support you.[AN]

I'm just so tired... Tired of fighting,[N]
tired of making decisions...[AN]
Tired of everything...[N]

[ML]What fools, throwing me into a cell I designed myself. It's only natural for me to prepare an escape route.
[MR][LoadMystery]
[MR]Running away again?
[ML]Ahh! What are you doing here? How did you even get in here?
[MR]You really shouldn't ask such useless questions. So, does he have it?
[ML]What?
[MR]The *****, of course. After all, your defeat has no bearing on our arrangement.
[ML]Hah... Hahahaha! You seriously think I have the slightest clue? Excuse me for worrying my own survival while you were off doing who knows what.
[MR]How unexpected... I thought you'd at least try to bluff your way out of here.
[ML]Your scorn has blinded you, I'm not that much of a fool. We both know you were never going to let me live.
[MR]Very insightful of you. For that, I'll grant you a swift end. Farewell, Louis.
[ML]Hah, I'll see you in hell.
