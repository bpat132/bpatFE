Morning, Rowan.[AN]
[MidRight][2LB]
Morning? It's afternoon already.[N]
How can you possibly sleep so much?[AN]
[MidLeft]
But I'm so bored, there's nothing for[N]
me to do![AN]
I thought this trip would be fun,[N]
but we spend so much time walking,[AN]
and whenever we're not, you just[N]
play with your swords all day![AN]
[MR]
It's not playing, it's training![AN]
How am I supposed to keep you safe[N]
if I slack on training?[AN]
[ML]
This wouldn't be a problem if you'd[N]
teach me to fight.[AN]
I'm no child, I should be able to[N]
protect myself.[AN]
[MR]
Like I said the last ten times, no way.[AN]
You'll only end up injuring yourself[N]
unless you build some muscle first.[AN]
[ML]
Isn't being fast and flexible enough?[N]
It works for you.[AN]
[MR][3LB]
It's true that my style of swordplay[N]
emphasizes speed over power, but I'm[N]
still strong enough to swing a sword.[AN]
[ML][2LB]
Fine, I'll just get stronger, and[N]
Then you'll have to teach me![AN]
Hm, what's all that noise outside?[N]
That's a whole lot of commotion.[AN]
[MR][1LB]
Stay here, I'll check it out.[AN]

Take a good look, lads.[AN]
Not a solider in sight, which means[N]
this port's ours for the taking![AN]

Pirates are attacking![N]
I'll protect you, so stay inside![AN]
[MidLeft][1LB]
But-[AN]
[MidRight][2LB]
Don't even think about leaving until[N]
I come back. It's for your own safety.[AN]
[MidRight][ClearFace]
[MidLeft]
How rude...[AN]
[ToggleRed]I'll just sneak out in three minutes[N]
or so and prove that I can help![ToggleRed][AN]

## TEXT_Ch5_Start_Rowan

[FarFarRight][MoveMidRight]
[MidRight]
Bad news, pirates are storming the port![N]
They've already docked three ships.[AN]
[MidLeft][1LB]
How's the situation look?[AN]
[MidRight][2LB]
Not good, they's a whole lot of them[N]
and I didn't see any guards around.[AN]
Don't think we can expect much help.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Damn... Even so, fleeing isn't an option.[AN]
If we can't take on a handful of pirates,[N]
how could we hope to face the army?[AN]
Get everyone ready for battle, we'll[N]
protect Port Krast with all our might![AN]
[MidRight][ClearFace]
[MidRight][LoadJane]
[MidRight][1LB]
Looks like you're back on your feet.[AN]
[MidLeft][3LB]
Can't say I don't have my doubts, but[N]
I've made my choice, and I intend to[N]
see it through.[AN]
Everyone's counting on me, I can't let[N]
my worries hurt morale.[AN]
[MidRight][2LB]
Good, keep it up and we may actually[N]
have a chance.[AN]
We could use a victory here, and[N]
I could use the practice.[AN]
[X]

## TEXT_Ch5_Start_Justin

Pirates again? If only I could fight[N]
them myself...[AN]
Alas, all I can do is pray for help[N]
to arrive.[AN]

[MidLeft][LoadEdgar][FarFarRight][LoadViolet]
[FarFarRight][MoveMidRight]
[MidRight][3LB]
How interesting...[N]
I don't know who you are, but it takes[N]
guts to pick a fight with these pirates.[AN]
[MidLeft][2LB]
Of course. We can handle them, no[N]
matter how many there are.[AN]
[MidRight]
I should warn you, they're a real tough[N]
bunch. Even the military fears them.[AN]
If you value your lives, I suggest[N]
fleeing while you can.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Thanks for your concern, but I have[N]
no intention of losing here.[AN]
[MidRight]
Haha, I like your confidence![N]
I suppose I'll help you out for now.[AN]
If by some miracle we manage to win,[N]
I'll land a promotion for sure![AN]
[MidRight][ClearFace]
[MidLeft]
She's clearly a solider, but it seems[N]
seem she doesn't know who we are.[AN]
I won't turn down help, but I hope she[N]
doesn't cause trouble for us later.[AN]

## TEXT_Ch5_Celia_Event
[Left][LoadCelia][3LB]
I can't hide inside while Rowan's[N]
fighting by all by himself.[AN]
I may not be able to swing a sword,[N]
but I can still help with my dance![AN]
I've finally gotten the hang of this[N]
rune too, I can't wait to see the look[N]
on Rowan's face when I invoke it.[AN]

## TEXT_Ch5_Ted_Event
[Right][LoadTed]
[Right]
The port's already a bloodbath...[AN]
What a fool I was, thinking I could[N]
be a pirate.[AN]

I don't plan on hurting anyone.[ToggleRed][AN]

What's an unarmed woman doing out here?[AN]
It's dangerous, get back inside before[N]
you get hurt![AN]
[MidLeft]
I'm not going anywhere! What gives a thug[N]
like you the right to boss me around?[AN]
You and your band of brutes are the[N]
ones who need to leave![AN]
[MidRight]
I don't want to hurt you, but I can't[N]
say the same about the rest of us.[AN]
You're lucky you ran into me first.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Even without a weapon I can help keep[N]
people safe from villains like you.[AN]
Trying to ease your guilt like this[N]
is simply pathetic![AN]
You think yourself any better than the[N]
rest of your crew? Don't make me laugh.[AN]
[MidRight]
You've got me there. Guess I've been[N]
a bit of a hypocrite, huh.[AN]
Alright then, looks like I'll have[N]
to protect you myself.[AN]
[MidLeft][1LB]
Huh? Are you still confused?[AN]
[MidRight][2LB]
I didn't want to admit it, but I made a[N]
grave mistake joining this crew.[AN]
You've convinced me to do what's right,[N]
no matter how difficult.[AN]
From now on, I'll fight for justice![AN]
[MidRight][ClearFace]
[MidLeft]
That was weird. Oh well, one less[N]
bad guy to worry about.[AN]

[MR]
Princess, what are you doing out here?[N]
You could have gotten yourself killed![AN]

[ML][1LB]
Edgar? Is that really you?
[MR][2LB]
Celia... It's been a while.[N]
What are you doing here?[AN]
[ML]
What am *I* doing here? I'm not the[N]
one everyone thinks is dead![AN]
I can't believe it...[N]
It's like I'm looking at a ghost.[AN]
[MR]
I'm not that easy to kill...[N]
Is what I'd like to say.[AN]
Truthfully, I'm lucky to be alive.[AN]
But Celia, I never imagined I'd see[N]
you on a battlefield.[AN]
I know how much you hate violence.[N]
Are you trying to get yourself killed?[AN]
[ML]
Yeah, I hate it. I still get a bit[N]
squeamish at the sight of blood.[AN]
But even so, I couldn't just cower[N]
and hide! You understand, right?[AN]
You're the same, playing vigilante[N]
like this.[AN]
[MR]
Vigilante? No, I was just in the right[N]
place at the right time.[AN]
Still, why are you here at all, so far[N]
from Kemaroa?[AN]
Melerra is a dangerous place these days.[AN]
[ML][3LB]
A friend of mine is on a journey of[N]
self-improvement, some sort of rite[N]
of passage for Kemaroan swordsmen.[AN]
I was dying for a chance to get out[N]
of the palace, so I tagged along.[AN]
[MR]
Is everything alright up there?[N]
I admit, I know little of how the[N]
war with Galt is going.[AN]
[ML][2LB]
It's not great, but we're holding them[N]
off. For now, at least.[AN]
That's not why I'm here though, I just[N]
couldn't bear to stay there any longer.[AN]
It's... suffocating.[AN]
But enough about me, seriously, what[N]
are you doing here?[AN]
I can't imagine you fight pirates[N]
for fun.[AN]
[MR]
It's a very, very long story.[N]
I'll fill you in back at the inn.[AN]

## TEXT_Ch5_End2
[ML][LoadCelia][MR][LoadEdgar]
[ML]That's quite a lot to take in.[AN]
You really mean to seize the capital[N]
with your numbers?[AN]
I'm no strategist, but that sounds[N]
completely suicidal.[AN]
[MR]
I know it won't be easy, but I really[N]
believe we can do it.[AN]
Failure isn't an option, so we'll[N]
make it happen no matter the odds.[AN]

If you're that confident...[N]
Alright, then. Rowan![AN]

We're going to help Edgar retake[N]
the throne of Melerra.[AN]
[FL][1LB]
What?![AN]
[MR]
What?![AN]
[FL][2LB]
Must I remind you that you can hardly[N]
lift a weapon?[AN]
The battlefield is no place for you.[AN]
[MR]
Sorry, Celia, I have to agree.[AN]
I couldn't bear for you to get[N]
hurt on my watch.[AN]
[FL]
Not to mention, the queen would have[N]
my head on a pike.[AN]
[L]
Ugh, she's way too overprotective.[AN]
Anyway, even if I can't swing a sword,[N]
I can still help in battle.[AN]
Surely you've realized my dances[N]
are not just for show.[AN]
[FL]
I've been meaning to ask about that.[N]
You weave some magic into them, right?[AN]
They have an uncanny ability to make[N]
me feel focused and rejuvenated.[AN]
[L]
That's right. Not just any dancer can[N]
do this, it's my special technique![AN]
[FL]
I'm not going to be able to talk you[N]
out of this, am I?[AN]
[MR][3LB]
Alright, you can come with us, but if[N]
you're ever in danger, prioritize[N]
your own safety.[AN]

Don't worry, I plan on[N]
living a long life.[AN]

I hear you're headed to the capital.[N]
Mind if I tag along?[AN]
[MR]
I'm afraid you've got the wrong man,[N]
I'm not in charge here.[AN]
[ML][3LB]
Ah right, you're the other blue-haired[N]
fellow. Still, you look like a pretty[N]
important guy.[AN]
I should have realized from the start,[N]
but it figures the only people who'd[N]
stand up to pirates would be rebels.[AN]
[MR][1LB]
Doesn't this make us enemies?[AN]
[ML][2LB]
I guess, but I don't really wanna[N]
fight you.[AN]
[MR][1LB]
You mean you plan to defect?[AN]
[ML][3LB]
I'm no fan of the regent or the empire,[N]
but there are people I care about[N]
stationed in the capital.[AN]
So long as I don't have to fight them,[N]
I can help you out.[AN]
Besides, if word gets out that I helped[N]
you guys I'll be thrown in prison.[AN]
[MR][2LB]
Then you can tag along, but I'll be[N]
keeping my eye on you.[AN]
Don't get any silly ideas of leaking[N]
our plans or whereabouts.[AN]
[ML][1LB]
Thanks, you won't regret it![AN]

This should be fine, right?[N]
She seems earnest enough.[AN]
I hope I made the right call.[AN]
